    <p class="css_text"> <font size="50"></font> CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
    CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images, advanced positions and many other things. Just wait and see!

        HTML can be (mis-)used to add layout to websites. But CSS offers more options and is more accurate and sophisticated. CSS is supported by all browsers today.

        After only a few lessons of this tutorial you will be able to make your own style sheets using CSS to give your website a new great look.<br>
        CSS was a revolution in the world of web design. The concrete benefits of CSS include:

        control layout of many documents from one single style sheet;
        more precise control of layout;
        apply different layout to different media-types (screen, print, etc.);
        numerous advanced and sophisticated techniques.

    <p class="jquery_text"><font size="50"></font> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

    <p class="java_text"><font size="50"></font>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. <br>
        It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java.<br>
        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server.<br>
        This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. <br>
        For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.

        IS SKELETON FRAMEWORK FOR YOU?

        You should use Skeleton Framework if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks.<br>
        Skeleton only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started.<br>
        In fact, this site is built on Skeleton Framework and has ~200 lines of custom CSS (half of which is the docking navigation).
